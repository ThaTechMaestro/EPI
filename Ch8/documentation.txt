    Procedure 1
    Attempt the question individually
        Observe your thought process
        Write them down as comments
        Note the wrong assumptions or questions(that's where you learn)
            (8.3)
            First wrong assumption was checking if my open_symbol_store was empty
            after we performed a pop operation, which in some cases it will.
            The catch for that test condition was to check if everytime we check to see if 
                we can append to a stack, if it is empty we have a closing bracket input
                which automatically renders the input invalid

        Write down where you got stuck and what exactly you find confusing
            Understanding the code for a test input of "()("
            mismatching input in cases of "()[)"

        Compare with the ideal solution you had in mind or were following


    Procedure 2 (Here)
    Look at other engineers solution and learn from it
        Understand the space and time complexity
        The important idea behind their implementation
        Seek to learn something new from it 
        Repeat Procedure 1
    

    Procedure 3:
